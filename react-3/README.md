## 🚀 Overview
**React-3** is a hands-on learning project built using **Vite + React**.  
It focuses on mastering **core React fundamentals** through small, practical examples — instead of only theoretical learning.  
This project helps you deeply understand **React Hooks**, **state**, **props**, and the **asynchronous nature** of state updates.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to **learn React by building** — observing how React behaves in real-time.  
You’ll explore how data flows, how components update, and how React efficiently handles rendering.

This approach helps build:
- Practical understanding of how React works internally.
- Confidence with React syntax and hooks.
- A strong foundation before moving to advanced React topics.

## 🧩 Key Learning Objectives

| 🧠 Concept | 💡 Description |
|-------------|----------------|
| **React Hooks** | Learn to use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects. |
| **State Management** | Understand how to store and update data within components. |
| **State in Functional Components** | Learn to handle state using hooks instead of class components. |
| **Asynchronous State Updates** | Observe how React batches multiple state updates and renders efficiently. |
| **State vs Props** | Understand the difference between component-owned data (`state`) and externally passed data (`props`). |
